# Vive tracker charging shield - Prot v1
## Introduction
**UNTESTED - WAITING FOR PARTS**
I saw some existing charging solutions for vives and they were kinda meh or pretty bad. Whenever i see a design that i dont particularly like i decide to recreate and improve upon it and i had some free time so i created this in ~ 4-5 hrs.
It uses 2 li-po batteries to achieve 2200+-100mAh of battery. *(1100 - 1300... commonly 1100. I may decide to sell since i buy in "bulk" for cheap for my slimevr trackers)*
Features a button switch to turn on and off and... my custom pcb for led backlit button but i may edit to allow for standard 3mm led + resistor use >.> my led boar was just easier because of my slimevr trackers.
Features 1a charge discharge even though vives only take 0.5 .-. stupid.
The top and bottom screw together using 12mm m3 socket cap screws.
Features 3d printed thread... to attach to track straps or whatever else *(idk i dont own vives)*
Features the whatever camera mount screw thing to screw onto the vives.
Features contact pins that are wacky af and interact with pin 2 (gnd) and pin 3 (vcc i assume) which will charge the vive pucks.
